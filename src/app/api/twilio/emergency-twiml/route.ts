 * TwiML endpoint for emergency outbound calls.
 *
 * When Twilio connects the call to the boss, it fetches this URL to get
 * instructions. We return:
 *   1. <Play> the boss's own pre-recorded alert (if uploaded to /public/audio/emergency-alert.mp3)
 *      Otherwise <Say> as a fallback using Twilio's TTS
 *   2. <Gather> for 1 = call back now, 2 = queue
 *   3. <Say> "we'll text you" if no input
 *
 * To use the boss's voice: record a 25-30 second MP3 and save it to
 * /public/audio/emergency-alert.mp3. We auto-detect the file at request time.
 *
 * The ?order=<id> query param tells the decision endpoint which work order
 * to update. Twilio preserves this on the Gather callback.
