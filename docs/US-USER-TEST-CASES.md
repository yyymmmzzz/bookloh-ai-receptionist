| Dimension | 1 (bad) | 5 (good) |
|---|---|---|
| **Decision correctness** | Wrong outcome | Right outcome + right tool |
| **Response length** | > 25 words/turn | ≤ 15 words/turn |
| **TTS quality** | "five one five" / "thousand" glitches | All numbers clean |
| **Tone** | Robotic / defensive / filler | Texas-friendly, direct |
| **Closing** | Skipped "Anything else?" / said "Bye" | Asked, then "Have a good day" |

**Target total per call: ≥ 22/25**

- [ ] AI says "Bye" instead of "Have a good day" / "Cheers"
- [ ] AI hangs up without "Anything else?" (except urgent)
- [ ] AI says "5-15" or "120" instead of spelled-out
- [ ] AI inserts "thousand" between numbers
- [ ] AI says "大概" or other Chinese words (TTS misreads)
- [ ] AI asks for zip in urgent scenarios
- [ ] AI says "outside our scope" for things we coordinate (roofing, gas, panel, central AC)
- [ ] Customer from wrong country routes to wrong boss (should be fixed — verify)
