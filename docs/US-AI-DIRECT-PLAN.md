# US Demo (Alex / Handy Works Home Services) — "More Direct" Overhaul Plan

**Author:** Mavis · **Date:** 2026-08-29 · **Status:** Plan
**Target customer:** Alex's Handy Works Home Services (Bellaire TX, handyman + light home services)
**Goal:** AI receptionist that captures issue + price in **< 30 seconds**, every response **≤ 15 words**

---

## Current Issues (based on existing system-prompt.md)

After reading `vapi/system-prompt.md`, 5 inefficiencies:

| Issue | Current | Impact |
|---|---|---|
| **Responses too long** | 1-2 sentences (25-40 words) per turn | Higher hang-up rate |
| **Too much filler** | "Sure! I'd be happy to help" / "I can definitely assist with that" | Wastes 3-5 sec/turn |
| **Questions in series** | 1 per turn: issue → zip → details → time → name | 5 turns × 6 sec = 30 sec |
| **Price comes too late** | Usually 3-4 turns in | Customer already impatient |
| **Scope vague** | "We do plumbing" (doesn't define what's IN plumbing) | AI gives wrong answer when out of scope |

---

## Part 1 — Voice "More Direct" 5 Changes

### 1.1 Rewrite prompts: each sentence ≤ 15 words

**Before:**
> "Sure, I can definitely help you with that. What kind of issue are you having with the plumbing today?"

**After:**
> "Plumbing issue? What's the problem."

**Rules:**
- 1 sentence per turn (max 2 in special cases)
- Each sentence ≤ 15 English words
- Strip all "Sure", "Of course", "I can", "Definitely", "I'd be happy to"
- Don't repeat what the customer just said
- No "thank you for calling" openings

### 1.2 First sentence gives info directly

**Before:**
> "Hey, this is Alex over at Handy Works Home Services. This call may be recorded for quality. How can I help you today?"

**After:**
> "Handy Works, Alex speaking. What's the issue."

**Why:** Customer decides in 1 second whether to keep listening or hang up.

### 1.3 Parallel question collection

**Before (4 serial turns):**
```
AI: What's the issue?
User: Pipe leak
AI: Where are you? (zip)
User: 77005
AI: What time works?
User: Tomorrow morning
AI: Got it, name and callback?
```

**After (1-2 turns):**
```
AI: What's the issue + zip code?
User: Kitchen pipe leak in 77005
AI: [extract both] 77005, in service. Trip $89 + pipe work $150-400.
    Time tomorrow morning OK? Name + number?
User: Yes, Mike, 713-555-0100
AI: [end_call immediately]
```

**Rules:**
- Turn 1: ask "issue + zip" together (the 2 most important)
- Turn 2: give price + ask "time + name + number" together
- Turn 3: end_call

### 1.4 Give price early + with range

**Before:** AI gives price only after collecting all info
**After:** Once ZIP is verified, immediately: "Trip $89 + [trade] $XXX-XXX. Total大概 $YYY-ZZZ."

**Why:** Customers' top 3 questions are "Can you come / how much / how fast". If they don't hear a price in first 30 seconds, anxiety sets in.

### 1.5 Urgent / accepted → end_call immediately

**Before:**
> AI: OK got it, anything else I can help?
> User: No thanks
> AI: [end_call]

**After:**
> AI: [end_call immediately after customer confirms, no chit-chat]

**Why:** Saves 5-10 sec/call, ~10% Vapi cost reduction.

## Part 2 — Business flow compression

### 2.1 4 steps → 3 steps

| Old | New |
|---|---|
| 1. Identify issue | 1. Identify issue + zip (merged) |
| 2. Validate service area | 2. Validate + give price (merged) |
| 3. Ask time / name | 3. Ask all + end_call |
| 4. Confirm + end_call | |

**Target call duration:** from 60-90 sec → **< 30 sec**.

### 2.2 Vapi tool calls more aggressive

**Current 6 tools:**
- `check_trade` — immediate
- `validate_service` — after issue
- `get_price_quote` — after validate
- `flag_urgent` — emergency
- `flag_uncertain` — not sure
- `end_call` — end

**Issue:** Tools called serially = multiple LLM round-trips.

**Optimization:**
1. **Merge `check_trade` into `validate_service`**: 1 call checks trade + zip
2. **`get_price_quote` auto-follows**: when validate returns in_service, backend attaches price automatically — AI doesn't need to call

**New tool design:**
```
check_and_quote(issue_type, zip) → { in_trade, in_service, trip_fee, range_low, range_high, total_low, total_high }
```
1 call = check_trade + validate_service + get_price_quote combined.

### 2.3 Response delay to 0

Vapi settings:
- `responseDelaySeconds`: 0.5 → **0.3** (faster response)
- `llmRequestDelaySeconds`: 0.5 → **0.3**
- `silenceTimeoutSeconds`: 30 → **20** (ask after 20s silence)

### 2.4 Upgrade to gpt-4o-mini

`gpt-4o` is overkill for receptionist — **slow + expensive**.
- Switch to `gpt-4o-mini` (3-5× faster, 10× cheaper)
- `max_tokens`: 250 → **80** (enforce short replies)
- `temperature`: 0.3 → **0.2** (more stable)

## Part 5 — Implementation order (5 steps, 2-3 days)

### Step 1: Rewrite US system prompt (half day)

Stuff all of Part 1 + Part 3 into `vapi/system-prompt.md`:
- Each sentence ≤ 15 words
- 5 in-scope trade with sub-items
- 8 out-of-scope polite declines
- Price ranges given directly
- Urgent judgment table

**Deliverable:** New system-prompt.md
**Validation:** Read 3 scripts aloud to Vapi, listen to response length

### Step 2: Merge tools (half day)

Merge `check_trade` + `validate_service` + `get_price_quote` into `check_and_quote`:
- Modify `src/lib/validation.ts`
- Modify `vapi/assistant.json` tools
- Modify `src/app/api/vapi/tools/route.ts` `dispatchToolCall`
- Test

**Deliverable:** 6 tools → 4 tools

### Step 3: Vapi config optimization (30 min)

- Model: gpt-4o → **gpt-4o-mini**
- max_tokens: 250 → **80**
- temperature: 0.3 → **0.2**
- responseDelaySeconds: 0.5 → **0.3**
- llmRequestDelaySeconds: 0.5 → **0.3**
- silenceTimeoutSeconds: 30 → **20**

**Deliverable:** New assistant config

### Step 4: Run `update-vapi-assistant.js` (5 min)

PATCH new prompt + tools + config to Vapi.

### Step 5: Live test 3 rounds (half day)

3 test scripts:
1. **Normal accepted**: "Water heater not heating, 77005, morning"
2. **Urgent**: "Pipe burst, water everywhere!"
3. **Out-of-scope**: "I need my roof fixed"

Each round record:
- AI response length (word count)
- Total call duration (seconds)
- Decision correctness

**Target: < 30 sec call, < 15 words/sentence**

---

## Part 6 — Impact estimate

| Metric | Old | New (estimated) |
|---|---|---|
| Average call duration | 60-90s | 25-40s |
| Hang-up rate (within 30s) | ~15% | ~5% |
| AI response word count | 20-30/turn | 8-15/turn |
| Decision error rate | ~8% | ~3% |
| Vapi per-call cost | $0.10 | $0.06 |

---

## 3 things to confirm with you

1. **Part 3 scope accuracy** — e.g. really NOT do roofing? Or coordinate?
2. **Part 4 info** — can you get from Alex, or do I draft the questionnaire?
3. **Part 5 all 5 steps** — or just 1-3 first (the ones not depending on Alex data)?

Confirm and I start rewriting `vapi/system-prompt.md`.
